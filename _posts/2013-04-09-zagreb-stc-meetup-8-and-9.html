<p>I am really sad that I failed to write anything about Zagreb STC MeetUp #8 and #9. Karlo wrote reports for <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2013/01/zagrebstc-8-meetup-report.html">both</a> <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2013/03/report-for-zagreb-stc-9.html">events</a>, so if you want to read a few words about the events, read his blog posts. I did take a few photos and I wanted to share them.</p>
