<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki">Zagreb STC MeetUp</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/69947212/">#5</a>. As always, it was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Å mid</a> at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a>.</p>
<p>Every time about ten testers and developers meet and talk about testing and software development in general. This time there were twelve of us. We started by introductions. I gave a short <a href="http://filipin.eu/test-automation-at-homeswap-com/">Test automation at HomeSwap.com</a> talk and Karlo introduced <a href="http://thebreretons.com/setgame/">the Set Game</a>. We were playing the game and discussing what would be the best way to automate it. I have created a <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/set">set repository at GitHub</a> where I will play with the automation these days, when I get a chance. For now the repository only has a few examples of a solved game and one failing test.</p>
<p>As usual, we ended the meetup with a lot of informal talks about everyday challenges.</p>
<p>A few of us brought the books we own and our little <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki/Library">library</a> continues! (I am reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Edition/dp/0471358460">Testing Computer Software</a> (2nd Edition) by Cem Kaner, Jack Falk and Hung Q. Nguyen.)</p>
<p>Of course there were pizza and soft drinks, thanks to <a href="http://asseco.com/see/contact/croatia/">Asseco</a>.</p>
