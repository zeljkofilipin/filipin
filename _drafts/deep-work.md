## TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

First, I'll summarize the book. In a sentence or two. Next, I'll summarize each part of the book. (There are two parts.) Then, I'll summarize each chapter. (The first part has three, the second part has four chapters.) Chapters are divided in sections. Depending on how long all of those summaries get, I might even summarize each section. We'll see.

## Introduction

There is high demand and low supply for people that can do deep work.

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
>
> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
>
> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

## Part 1: The Idea

### Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

You have to learn hard things quickly. That requires you to focus intensely, without distraction.

#### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

> Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy
>
> - The ability to quickly master hard things.
> - The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
>
> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.

#### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

> To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.

#### Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

#### What About Jack Dorsey?

> Jack Dorsey helped found Twitter. After stepping down as CEO, he then launched the payment-processing company Square.
>
> Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare.

### Chapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare

> ... big trends in business today [open offices, instant messaging, social media] actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level).

#### The Metric Black Hole

We intuitively know the cost of distraction and the value of depth. It's hard, if not impossible, to measure knowledge work.

> Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has value, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are difficult to measure.
>
> Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts.

#### The Principle of Least Resistance

When we don't know what's the best thing do to next, we usually do the easy things first. Occurring meetings and bad e-mail messages are easy. Write e-mails in a way that is not only easy to respond, but easy to resolve the thread.

> The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

#### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity

An easy way, but a wrong way, to show our value is to look busy.

> Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: ... doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

#### The Cult of the Internet

We are not thinking about advantages and disadvantages of new technologies, but blindly accepting them. Deep work requires very careful selection of tools.

> We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.
>
> ... to support deep work often requires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech.

#### Bad for Business. Good for You.

Deep work is valuable and rare. Develop the skill of deep work and the world is yours.

> ... depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. ... develop your personal ability to go deep—and by doing so, reap great rewards.
