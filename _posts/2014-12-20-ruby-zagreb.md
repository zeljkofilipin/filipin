# TLDR

I have attened almost all [Ruby Zagreb](http://www.meetup.com/rubyzg/) meetups. Unfortunatelly, I did not have the time to write something about the meetups, but I did take a few photos every time.

Next week I will give a talk about RuboCop at Ruby Zagreb meetup, so now is the time to document the meetups so far.

# Misc

- As far as I know, I have attended [the first ever Ruby meetup in Zagreb](/2008/04/07/ruby-on-beers.html) (and Croatia).
