<p>I have already written about <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2006/11/10/tests-and-how-to-documents/">Tests and How-To Documents</a>.</p>
<p>How cool is <a href="http://my.ibpinitiative.org/public/help/">this</a>? If you have one of those cool browsers like Firefox or Opera, <a href="http://my.ibpinitiative.org/public/help/default.ff.htm">this page</a> is even cooler. :)</p>
<p>The essence of that page is made automatically while my tests were running. <a href="http://edge4dev.wordpress.com/">My developer</a> added a little CSS and JavaScript (<a href="http://www.mootools.com/">Mootools</a>) magic to it, and now it looks really nice.
