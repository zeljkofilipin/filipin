## Introduction

I wrote a draft for this article in 2018. It has remained a draft since then. The last responsible moment to publish it is long gone. I have many notes about the topic, but I do not think I am ready to write a post about it yet. But, since a few people have asked me to share the notes, I will do my best.

I am very interested in [career development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_development). I have tried to talk about it at [Testival meetup](/zagreb-stc-18) in 2015 and [Testival conference](/testival-2016) in 2016. (*Tried* means I've proposed the topic but it was not selected for the event.) I gave a five-minute lightning talk about it at [Testival](/testival-31) meetup and [WebCamp](/webcamp-zagreb-2017) conference in 2017 and lead a one-hour session at [CITCON](/citcon-2018) conference in 2018.

All three talks consisted of two parts. First, I would ask the audience what they think is a good way to develop a career. I would take notes. Only then, in the second part, would I share my thoughts. I did not want to influence the audience. Every time the result was different. The first two times I gave short five-minute lightning talks. They were short, but they helped me develop my thoughts. The last time was a one-hour open-space session. It was very different in many ways.

## Random thoughts

Some of my thoughts that were not mentioned by others at the events.

### You are in responsible for your career

Not your company. Not your manager. You are responsible.

### Time to start thinking about your career is now

It's too late to start when you lose a job. Prepare for the next job while you still have one. If you like the job you have, feel free to keep it for years or decades. Just, don't assume you'll be able to keep it for years or decades. Things change. You might be fired. The company might close. Today.

### It is very unlikely that you will reach retirement age while still working for your current company

TODO: find reference.

I've read somewhere that the average time an average person stays at a job is five years. Plan for that.

### You should be the one to decide when to retire

You should not get into situation that your skills are obsolete, and you have to retire.

## Shared Thoughts

These things were mentioned at two events. I did not find anything that was mentioned at all three events.

- Contribute to open source projects.
- Go to events, like meetups, conferences and workshops.
- Read. Books, blogs, documentation, magazines...
- Establish online presence: Stack Overflow, GitHub, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, blog...
- Have a Twitter account and use it to connect to people from your industry.
- Networking is important.
- Speak at events.

## Testival

At Testival meetup, the audience were mostly testers.

- Learn the tools needed for work. Since Testival gathers testers, they were mostly interested in test automation tools.
- Try new things. Tools, programming languages...
- Have a blog and write about work related topics.
- Watch relevant videos, on YouTube for example.
- Look for a company that would help you advance in your career.

## WebCamp

At WebCamp conference, the audience were mostly developers.

- Help organize events.
- Establish yourself as a thought leader.
- Innovate.
- Learn.
- Create projects.
- Practice.

## CITCON

CITCON session was much longer than previous two, and completely different. The audience was mixed, developers and testers.

- There are several ways to think about career:
  - personal development,
  - climbing the ladder in your current company.
- In both of the above cases, you should talk with your manager about your career.
- Improve your development skills, with Udacity for example.
- Reflect about your career. Yearly review is a good way to do it.
- Follow the market (LinkedIn...). What is in demand?
- Be active at LinkedIn.
- Acquire new skills.
- Get a mentor. It does not need to be a permanent or formal relationship. Anybody you are seeking advice from could be your current mentor.
- Stay in touch with people you meet at events. A relevant email/Twitter/Slack message every few months should be enough.
- Focus.
- Practice interviews. Apply for a job here and there just to keep your interviewing skills.
