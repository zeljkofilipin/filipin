title: Important things I didn't learn in school
---
- it is really important to exercise regularly
- art is important, which one is for you to choose, for me it's playing music
- everybody earns and spends money, nobody really knows how to do it well
- find meaning of life, a hint, it's not earning a lot of money or owning a lot of things
- recommend a book/app for each
