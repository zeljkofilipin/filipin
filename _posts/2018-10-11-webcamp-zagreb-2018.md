The conference is organized by local tech meetups, I was the representative of 🐞 [Testival](http://www.testival.eu/). It lasts two days, Friday and Saturday. In addition to two main tracks, this year there was an unconference track that I have helped with. I was also helping with beer 🍻, so I did not have much time to attend the talks 🎤. I did manage to see both keynotes 🗝, and both were really good.
