<p>A couple of weeks ago I was in Utrecht and Amsterdam for a few days. I was there to work with <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> (wiki software that Wikipedia uses) developers <a href="https://github.com/hashar">Antoine "hashar" Musso</a> and <a href="http://about.me/timotijhof">Timo Tijhof (Krinkle)</a>. We also attended <a href="http://www.wikimediaconferentie.nl/">Wikimedia Conferentie Nederland 2012</a> and <a href="https://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hackathon_2012/en">Wikimedia Nederland Hackathon 2012</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon and Thursday we were working from Wikimedia Nederland office in Utrecht.</p>
<p>On Friday we attened the conference in Utrecht. One of three <a href="https://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/WCN_2012">tracks</a> was almost completely in English. The talks were pretty interesting. Since I am not really familiar with MediaWiki, the most interesting talk for me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> (Wikipedia co-founder) keynote.</p>
<p>On Saturday we traveled to Amsterdam for the hackathon. Since I am pretty new to both the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a> (a non-profit foundation that runs various open-content wiki projects including <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>) and MediaWiki, most of the time while we were at the office or at the hackathon I was just trying to figure out how everything is set up. More specifically, I was working on <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/browsertests">MediaWiki browser tests</a> or trying to <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/wmf-vagrant">install MediaWiki locally via Vagrant</a>. I have found the bug in the installation script, <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2012-November/064348.html">reported</a> it and it got <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/wmf-vagrant/pull/3">fixed</a> in 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>The last hour or two of the hackathon we had a few short talks. I gave a talk on how to install MediaWiki locally via Vagrant and how <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/qa-browsertests">MediaWiki browser tests</a> are set up. Timo talked about how MediaWiki and jQuery use <a href="https://github.com/jquery/testswarm">TestSwarm</a> to test JavaScript (<a href="http://swarm.jquery.org/">jQuery TestSwarm</a>). We had a few more talks, but I forgot the details.</p>
<p>By the way, according to my experience, everybody in the Netherlands speaks English. And I mean everybody. I have asked a few random people in the street, store or restaurant if they speak English and I got "yes" every single time. And pretty good English by the way.</p>
<p>Another surprising thing is lack of cars, really good public transportation and a surprising number of bikes. I was told that there will be a lot of bikes, so I was expecting it, but the number exceeded my expectations.</p>
