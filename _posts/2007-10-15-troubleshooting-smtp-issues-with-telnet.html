<p>I have really bad memory. I have to write this down. I just know I will forget it, but need it later.</p>
<p>I had to find out why one user did not receive any mail from us. I tried the usual things, but all looked fine. <a href="http://edge4dev.wordpress.com/">My developer</a> suggested to troubleshoot it with telnet. I found good article about <a href="http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/trench/9879.html">troubleshooting SMTP issues</a>. What I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>open command prompt</li>
<li>find server<code><br />
>nslookup -querytype=MX [domain]<br />
...<br />
Non-authoritative answer:<br />
[domain] MX preference = [integer], mail exchanger = [subdomain].[domain]<br />
...<br />
</code>
</li>
<li>connect to that machine with telnet<code><br />
>telnet [subdomain].[domain] 25<br />
</code>
</li>
<li>
good<br />
<code>220 SMTP Proxy Server Ready</code>
</li>
<li>
not so good<br />
<code>554 Transaction Failed Listed in connection control deny list</code>
</li>
</ul>
