<p><a href="http://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin/status/3685550585">A few days ago</a> it was exactly 5 years since I started working as a software tester. I planned to publish this on the very date, but life happened.</p>
<p>What happened in the last five years? Am I smarter? Or just older? Let's find out.</p>
<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>
<p><img src="assets/snorkel.JPG" alt="snorkel" title="snorkel" /></p>
<p>In the last five years I have upgraded LifeOS™ from 26.0 to 31.0, upgraded Girlfriend 5.0 application to Wife 4.0 and installed Son 1.5. I do not use DistanceRunning application so much any more, but I do my best. Drums 1.0 are lost somewhere and Guitar 1.0 is mainly collecting digital dust. No so sure about smarter, but definitely older.</p>

<p><strong>Professional</strong></p>

<p>Five years ago I had a job I did not like. I thought software (programming to be precise) is so cool, and I wished I could develop it for a living. No luck back then.</p>
<p><img src="assets/bear.jpg" alt="bear" title="bear" /></p>
<p>I still think software is lots of fun, and I live in code as much as I can. But, now I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">software testing</a> is even cooler, and I know I was born to be a tester. Not only do I have a job I would do even if I did not have to work, but I get to work from home. A dream I had since I was just a little kid.</p>

<p><strong>Programming Languages</strong></p>
<p><img src="assets/fire.jpg" alt="fire" title="fire" /></p>
<p>My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> skills declined a bit in the last five years, but I am sure I would be up and running in minutes if I ever needed them. (Looks like I had a thing for UPPERCASE languages back then.)<br />
I have picked up some <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> in the last few years, and I even made it to the <a href="http://watir.com/community/">Watir core team</a>! Not bad for a simple tester from Croatia, right?! :)</p>

<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<p><img src="assets/web.JPG" alt="web" title="web" /></p>
<p>Five years ago, I had a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050205073212/web.vip.hr/zeljko.filipin.vip/">crappy site</a> with a crappy URL. (In Croatian only. Some stuff is missing because it is archive.org snapshot, but it did not look much better anyway.)<br />
Today, I am all over the place. (I even have a place where I try to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/zeljkofilipin">aggregate</a> my web presence.) I have a <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/">great site</a> with great URL. Five years ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> just started to appear, now I have <a href="http://watirpodcast.com/">one</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Watir</strong></p>
<p><img src="assets/sea.jpg" alt="sea" title="sea" /></p>
<p>I already mentioned <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a>, a tool that I use almost every day, and it makes my life much easier. <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/category/software/watir/">Big portion</a> of this site is dedicated to it. I like it so much I talk about <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2007/11/26/smoke-on-the-watir/">it</a> <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2008/05/12/ruby-on-beers-2/">to</a> <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2009/01/27/barcamp-zagreb-2009/">anybody</a> <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2009/03/08/spletne-urice-106/">that</a> <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2009/03/14/webindustrija-2009/">would</a> <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2009/05/11/dorscluc-2009/">listen</a>. I even <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2009/01/17/awta-2009/">flew across the ocean</a> to meet with people that like Watir.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It really takes a lot of time to write a blog post. No wonder I do not write so much.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the final score:</p>
<blockquote><p>Smarter vs. Older - 3:1</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like Smarter won. Maybe another jury would vote differently.</p>
<p>If you remember only one thing from this post, I hope it will be the title:</p>
<blockquote><p>Test like you do not need the money.</p></blockquote>
