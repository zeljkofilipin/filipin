<p>From <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~iheckman/allsnap/">allSnap's home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>allSnap is a small system tray app that makes all top level windows automatically align like they do in programs such as Winamp or Photoshop.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have heard about it while listening to <a href="http://www.grc.com/sn/notes-065.htm">Security Now! Episode #65</a>. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p>...Ivan Heckman's wonderful and clean little Windows "allSnap" utility (which causes all Windows windows to snap to screen and other window borders)...</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been using it for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with it. I can not really say much about such software, and why I find it useful, you will just have to try it. Leave a comment if you also find it useful (or not).</p>
