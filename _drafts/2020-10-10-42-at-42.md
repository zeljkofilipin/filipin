I've had this crazy idea of running 42 km (26 miles) on my 42nd birthday. I wasn't ready at the time, so I've ran a half marathon (21 km or 13 miles). I've realized that I'll have 42 years for an entire year, so not everything was lost. I've planned to run Wachau marathon, but it was cancelled. I've then planned to run Zagreb marathon, but it was cancelled too. In the end, I've decided to run the marathon alone. (With some help from family and friends. Like riding with me on a bike so I don't have to carry a few liters of water on my back the whole time.)

There are several bridges on the Sava river that flows thru Zagreb. I usually run on it's riverbank. The plan is to run a loop from Jankomirski most (Jankomir bridge) to Domovinski most (Homeland bridge).
