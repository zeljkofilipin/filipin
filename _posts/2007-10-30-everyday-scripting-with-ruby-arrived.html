<p>Long long time ago, I was reviewer of <a href="http://www.testing.com/">Brian Marick's</a> <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bmsft/">Everyday Scripting with Ruby</a>. On February 2, 2007 Pragmatic Programmers said they would send me a free copy, but it <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2007/04/12/everyday-scripting-with-ruby-for-teams-testers-and-you-by-brian-marick/">did not arrive</a> for a long time. I exchanged a few e-mails with them, and today the book arrived. I did not even have time to unwrap it yet. :)</p>
