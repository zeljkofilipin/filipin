# On Reading

My manager has recommended this book a while back. My to-read list is pretty big so it was there for a while. Recently, I've listened to the audio book. I was really impressed with the book. So impressed that I've bought the e-book, to read it again.

I've found that approach to work very well for me. I listen to a lot of audio books. That allows me to read a lot. But, listening to audio books is not deep work. I'm usually doing something else, like driving, cleaning or running. Rarely, I'll read a book that's so good that I want to immediately read it again. Deep work is one of those rare books.

The second time I've read it as an e-book on my old Kindle. I like reading on Kindle because of it's e-ink screen, it's small size and lack of distractions. It does allow me to highlight sections and sync it to the cloud, so it's easy later to review highlights on a computer and copy/paste to a blog post, if needed.

Sometimes, while listening to an audio book, I'll have an idea, but since I don't have an easy way to write it down, I usually forget it.

For a long time I was not happy with my productivity. I tend to start many projects, but did not finish them as quickly as I wanted. I think deep work and the second essential tool in my daily work. The other one being GTD. I don't think any one of them solves all of my project planning problems, but together, they work magic.

For example, I can't really focus on a task for hours or days if I know there are other urgent things to do. Or even if I'm not sure if there are other urgent or important things to do. To be really productive, I have to spend some time reviewing my current projects, making sure I'm not missing any deadlines, or that there isn't anything more important to do at the moment. With my mind free of thinking about that, I can focus all of my attention at one task.

If you've ever worked hard all day but you felt you didn't do almost anything, except answer a lot of mail, this book is for you.

One mistake I used to do a lot of to check my mail in the morning. That usually ended with me spending the majority of the day, if not the whole day in my inbox. These days I'll make sure to work on a project or two in the morning, and check my mail only after lunch, or even later in the day, when I feel that I don't have energy left for deep work. I can usually triage mail with very little brain power.

Even if you manage to triage your mail in the morning and you have the afternoon for working on projects, I'm usually more tired and less productive in the afternoon. It really makes little sense to spend the best hours of your day (morning) on mail. You should work on a hard problem then, and check mail in the afternoon.

One of the problem of e-mail is that it produces more e-mail. If you respond to all of your messages in an hour or two, by the time you're done, you'll receive answers to some of the messages and the never ending circle of e-mail continues.

Another problem are meetings. I've tried to get out of as many meetings as I could. For a while I had a fear of missing out, because sometimes I would learn valuable information at meetings. Also, I didn't want to look like I'm avoiding work. I had a chat with my manager (he recommended Deep Work in the first place) and he agreed that I should leave the meetings I didn't think are providing value. I've also marked Tuesdays and Fridays as "busy" in my work calendar, so people know not to schedule meetings with me.

One way of dealing with fear of missing out from not attending meetings (especially department and company-wide) is to let my manager know about that and to ask him to let me know if there's something important that I've missed. Missing out on weekly project or team meetings - I think my colleagues are good enough to reach out to me if they think I need to know something, or smart enough to reach out to me if they need my help. It's still early days for that experiment, but I didn't notice missing out anything yet.

TODO: find a post by Shime that compares audio books and reading a book.

# Introduction

> The term “deep work” is my own

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

> The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers.

> This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking.

> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

> In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative—constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages

> We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work.

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

> This book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to convince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life.

> Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

> A deep life is a good life.

# Part 1: The Idea

## Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

> Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy
>
> - The ability to quickly master hard things.
> - The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

> If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.

> If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.

> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.

> Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

> To learn requires intense concentration.

> This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.

> To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work.

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

> when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.

> To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

> Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare.

## Chapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare

Joel Spolsky of was way ahead of it's time when he introduced private offices in the Joel test.

> Facebook, of course, is not the only Silicon Valley heavyweight to embrace the open office concept.

> Another big business trend in recent years is the rise of instant messaging.

> A third trend is the push for content producers of all types to maintain a social media presence.

> I mention these three business trends because they highlight a paradox.

> Many other ideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world, including, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication, and an active presence on social media.

> To summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level).

> He discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a million dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails,

> Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has value, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are difficult to measure.

> Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts.

> The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

> To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier.

> To name another example, consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier.

Writing e-mail messages (and instant messages), phabricator tasks and similar in a way that the other person can quickly and easily respond might be harder to you short-term, but much better long-term.

> Also consider the frustratingly common practice of forwarding an e-mail to one or more colleagues, labeled with a short open-ended interrogative, such as: “Thoughts?”

> A little more care in crafting the message by the sender could reduce the overall time spent by all parties by a significant fraction.

> Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value.

> Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: ... doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

> Postman argued that our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.

> We no longer see Internet tools as products released by for-profit companies, funded by investors hoping to make a return, and run by twentysomethings who are often making things up as they go along. We’re instead quick to idolize these digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new world.

> Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. Even worse, to support deep work often requires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech.

> Deep work should be a priority in today’s business climate. But it’s not.

> depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Having just established that there’s nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and nothing fundamentally necessary about the distracting behaviors that displace it, you can therefore continue with confidence with the ultimate goal of this book: to systematically develop your personal ability to go deep—and by doing so, reap great rewards.

## Chapter 3: Deep Work Is Meaningful

> It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another:

> deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.

> The world represented by your inbox, in other words, isn’t a pleasant world to inhabit.

> “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow

> Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock.

> Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

> When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they suspected.

> Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.

> the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding.

> “jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.”

> A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.
