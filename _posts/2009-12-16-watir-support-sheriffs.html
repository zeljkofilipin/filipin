<p>Recently I became <a href="http://watir.com/team/">Watir community manager</a>.</p>
<p>Watir team had a little chat and we decided it would be a good idea to grow. So, one of the first duties I had as community manager was to promote two community members to support sheriffs.</p>
<p>I am glad I can announce that <a href="http://tcfodor.wordpress.com/">Tiffany Fodor</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/cjq.999">Wesley Chen</a> have accepted to be added to Watir community team with title of support sheriff.</p>
<p>[gallery columns="6"]</p>
<p>Tiffany answers a lot of questions and Wesley is helping us moderate the group. I hope both of them will continue with business as usual.</p>
<p>If you have a nice word for them, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/watir-general/browse_thread/thread/b15a5a6a253735f9">now is the time</a>. :)</p>
