<p>Yesterday I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that if you have a file with wmv extension you can listen to it on your mp3 player?</p></blockquote>
<p>I remembered that I have heard that in a podcast, but I could not find that podcast in the time of writing. I found it today. It is <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=205">Venkat Subramaniam and Andrew Hunt Talk Agile</a> from a podcast that I do not listen regulary, <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks!</a>.</p>
<p>From that episode <a href="http://perseus.franklins.net/dotnetrocks_0205_venkat_and_andy.pdf">transcript</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All someone needs to do is rename the WMV File to WMA, and it becomes audio only, and then there’re so many tools to convert that to MP3 if your MP3 player  doesn’t support WMA.</p></blockquote>
