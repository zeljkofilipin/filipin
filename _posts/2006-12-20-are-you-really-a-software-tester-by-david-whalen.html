<p>I have just read <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&ObjectType=ART&ObjectId=11794&tth=DYN&tt=siteemail&iDyn=2">Are You Really a Software Tester?</a> by David Whalen. It is a short, funny story. He describes how he tested search feature of computer terminal at the local bookstore. It reminded me of numerous times when I was in similar situation.</p>
