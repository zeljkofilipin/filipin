<p>I was looking for a site that would collect all audio podcasts on software testing. Since I could not find it, I had to create it myself. It is called <a href="http://testingpodcast.com/">Testing Podcast</a>. It is far from finished, but I think it is usable. I have collected all audio podcasts on software testing that I could find. If I have missed something, please let me know.</p>
