<p>I have heard about <a href="http://www.trojanhorsethebook.com/books/zero-day/">Zero Day</a> and <a href="http://www.trojanhorsethebook.com/books/trojan-horse/">Trojan Horse</a> novels by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich">Mark Russinovich</a> at <a href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm">Security Now</a> podcast. Steve has recommended the book several times. Mark appeared as a guest at <a href="http://twit.tv/sn/370">episode 370</a> of the podcast.</p>
<p>I have "gently" mentioned to my wife that I would like to read the books, so I got them as a present. I have read both books and I have really liked them. I will not go into a lot of detail, but both books talk about what could happen if somebody really wanted to take advantage of problems in contemporary software. I would recommend both books. On the podcast, Mark mentioned he is writing the third book. I am looking forward to reading it.</p>
