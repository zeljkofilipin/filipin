I'm really surprised that I've never written about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've used many blogging tools since I've started blogging in 2005. I like Jekyll because it's simple. Post are [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. GitHub support Jekyll via [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

You can see the source for this post at TODO.

I have written in [Visual Studio Code + Neovim](/vscode-neovim) about TODO.


{% highlight console %}
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --incremental
{% endhighlight %}

If you add this to your `Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` TODO

{% highlight json %}
{
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
}
{% endhighlight %}
