# Introduction

I wrote a draft for this article in 2018. It has been a draft since then. The last responsible moment to publish it is long gone. I have many notes about the topic, but I do not think I am ready to write a post about it yet. But, since a few people have asked me to share the notes, I will do my best.

I am very interested in [career development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_development). I have tried to talk about it at [Testival meetup](/zagreb-stc-18) in 2015 and [Testival conference](/testival-2016) in 2016. (*Tried* means I've proposed the topic but it was not selected for the meetup/conference.) I gave lightning talks about it at [Testival](/testival-31) meetup and [WebCamp](/webcamp-zagreb-2017) conference in 2017 and lead a session on it at [CITCON](/citcon-2018) conference in 2018.

All three talks consisted of two parts. First, I would ask the audience what they think is a good way to develop a career and take notes. Only then, in the second part would I share my thoughts. I did not want to influence the audience. Every time the result was different. The first two times I gave short five-minute lightning talks. They helped me develop my thoughts. The last time was a one hour open-space session. It was very different in many ways.

# My Thoughts

I consider these important, but nobody mentioned it during the talks.

- You are in responsible for your career.
- Time to start thinking about your career is now.
- It is very unlikely that you will reach retirement age while still working for your current company.
- You should be the one to decide when to retire. You should not get into situation that your skills are obsolete.

# Shared Thoughts

These things were mentioned at two events. I did not find anything that was mentioned at all three events.

- Contribute to open source projects.
- Go to events, like meetups, conferences and workshops.
- Read. Books, blogs, documentation, magazines...
- Establish online presence: Stack Overflow, GitHub, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, blog...
- Have a Twitter account and use it to connect to people from your industry.
- Networking is important.
- Speak at events.

# Testival

At Testival meetup, the audience were mostly testers.

- Learn the tools needed for work. Since Testival gathers testers, they were mostly interested in test automation tools.
- Try new things. Tools, programming languages...
- Have a blog and write about work related topics.
- Watch relevant videos, on YouTube for example.
- Look for a company that would help you advance in your career.

# WebCamp

At WebCamp conference, the audience were mostly developers.

- Help organize events.
- Establish yourself as a thought leader.
- Innovate.
- Learn.
- Create projects.
- Practice.

# CITCON

CITCON session was much longer than previous two, and completely different. The audience was mixed, developers and testers.

- There are several ways to think about career:
  - personal development,
  - climbing the ladder in your current company.
- In both of the above cases, you should talk with your manager about your career.
- Improve your development skills, with Udacity for example.
- Reflect about your career. Yearly review is a good way to do it.
- Follow the market (LinkedIn...). What is in demand?
- Be active at LinkedIn.
- Acquire new skills.
- Get a mentor. It does not need to be a permanent or formal relationship. Anybody you are seeking advice from could be your current mentor.
- Stay in touch with people you meet at events. A relevant email/Twitter/Slack message every few months should be enough.
- Focus.
- Practice interviews. Apply for a job here and there just to keep your interviewing skills.
