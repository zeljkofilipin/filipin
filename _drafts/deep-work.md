# TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

I'll assume your time and attention is limited. I'll first try to summarize the book. (In a sentence or two). If the summary sounds interesting, continue reading. Otherwise, stop reading. Then, I'll try to summarize each  part of the book. (There are two parts.) If you're still reading, make the same decision as before. If it's still interesting - continue, if not - stop. Next, I'll summarize each chapter. The first part has three chapters, the second part has four chapters. Chapters are divided in sections. Depending on how long all of those summaries get, I might even summarize each section. We'll see.

## Introduction

There is high demand and low supply for people that can do deep work.

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
>
> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
>
> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
