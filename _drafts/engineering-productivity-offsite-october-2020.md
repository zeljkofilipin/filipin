title: Engineering Productivity Offsite October 2020
---
In October 2020 (26-29) my team had it's second virtual offsite. The first one was in May 2020. The structure of the offsite was similar to the May offsite. About four hours every day, from Monday to Thursday.

I've participated in several sessions. One session was pairing on setting up Phabricator locally using Docker. Another was Screenshot Tests, Automated Testing, and Data Driven Testing. I've lead a session on writing a blog post. The last day we've played a few games together, including [Trivia Murder Party](https://www.jackboxgames.com/trivia-murder-party/) and [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us).
