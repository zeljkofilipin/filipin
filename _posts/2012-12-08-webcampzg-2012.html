<p>A couple weeks ago I was at <a href="http://webcampzg.org/">WebCampZg 2012</a>. The talks were pretty interesting but, as usual, even more interesting was the unofficial part of the conference. I had a long lunch (and a few beers) with <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Å mid</a>. We were talking about software development in general, about testing and it's future, starting a business... I returned pretty late to the conference, just in time for the last talk and after party (beers again). After party was also really interesting and to my surprise I have stayed until the very end.</p>
