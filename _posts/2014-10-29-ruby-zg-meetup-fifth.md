Yesterday I was at [Ruby::ZG::Meetup.fifth](http://www.meetup.com/rubyzg/events/212405822/). Radan Skoric talked about bussines logic ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ruby_Zagreb_Meetup_5_Radan_Skoric.jpg), [slides](http://radanskoric.github.io/ror_business_logic_presentation/#/)) and Bruno Sutic about Arel ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ruby_Zagreb_Meetup_5_Bruno_Sutic.jpg), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/brunosutic/introduction-to-arel)).

After the offical part, we went to [Medvedgrad](http://pivnica-medvedgrad.hr/) brewpub. Both talks were about Ruby on Rails, and since I don't use it, they were not that interesting to me, so the interesting part started there. I had a nice chat with a few people about various topics, including (but not limited to) freelancing, running Linux on Chromebook, software craftmanship, finding a mentor, Coderetreat...

What have I learned?

- Zagreb has a vibrant Ruby community.
- The most important stuff is still discussed over beer.
- Things have changed since [the first local Ruby meetup](http://zeljkofilipin.com/ruby-on-beers/).
- The only decent beer Medvedgrad has is Grička vještica (the witch of [Grič](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradec,_Zagreb)), and even that one is just slighly above meh. :P
