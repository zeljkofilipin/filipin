<p>Yesterday I had a <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> chat with <a href="http://www.rosiesherry.com/blog/">Rosie Sherry</a>. I found her blog because she has a <a href="http://www.rosiesherry.com/softwaretesting/show/%C5%BDeljko+Filipin">link to my blog</a>. I just wanted to know how she found my blog. She was not sure if she found it on Google or she followed a link from another blog.</p>
<p>But, this is not what I wanted to write about. She surprised me with this sentence.</p>
<blockquote><p>You come up on the third page of Google for <em>software testing blog</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had to check it immediately. She was not joking. I also checked my <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">PageRank™</a>. It was 4.</p>
<p>I started playing with different search terms, and if you use <a href="http://www.google.hr/">google.hr</a> (I am from Croatia) and search for <em>blog on software testing</em> this blog will be ranked 10th! The first page! (On <a href="http://www.google.com/">google.com</a> it is 12th.)</p>
<p>I have been changing the title of my blog from <em>Željko Filipin</em> to <em>Željko Filipin's Blog</em> to <em>Željko Filipin on Software Testing</em> and finally to <em>Željko Filipin’s Blog on Software Testing</em>. I think this title is the best description of this blog. And, it really helped being ranked so high.</p>
