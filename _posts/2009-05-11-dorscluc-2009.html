<p>Last week I was at <a href="http://www.open.hr/dc2009/">DORS/CLUC 2009</a>. It is three day open source conference in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
<p>The first day I had a <a href="http://www.open.hr/dc2009/wiki/index.php?page=LightningTalks">lightning talk</a> titled something like: <em>How did delivering our web application to client look like before we automated tests and how it looks today?</em> It was just an introduction to my Watir talk the next day.</p>
<p>The talk was a lot of fun. I really like to show off how Watir is useful, easy to use and, of course, just cool. :) This was the first time I did some live Watir coding using Linux and Firewatir and I had some problems, but nothing serious. (I usually use Windows and Watir::IE.)</p>

<p>Also, this was the first time I had a workshop (about 3 hours). We spent a few hours doing some basic Watir tests.</p>
<p>It was nice to see what other people are doing and to meet some familiar faces. There was a lot of intersting presentations, and also a lot of presentations that were a bit boring to me. The usual. The best presentation was by <a href="http://www.rot13.org/~dpavlin/">Dobrica Pavlinušić</a> on freeing hardware. Topic not really interesting to me, but Dobrica is just the funniest presenter I have seen so far.</p>
<p>There is Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=dorscluc">#dorscluc</a> channel, Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/dorscluc2009/">dorscluc2009</a> tag and #dorscluc channel at irc.freenode.net projected by one projector all the time.</p>
