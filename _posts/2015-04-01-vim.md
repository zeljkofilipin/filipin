# TLDR

[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) is one of the two most popular text editors, the other one being [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs).

# The story

Before getting involved in the [editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war), let me tell you a story.

As everybody else that writes code for living, I have used a lot of editors and IDEs. I liked some more than others. What was always intiguing to me was the fanaticism of Vim and Emacs users. I have tried both. For a minute. My first impression was [what is this I don’t even](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-is-this-i-dont-even)...?!

I remember the times when I would type `git commit` and end up in Vim by mistake. The only thing I knew was to very carefully close it with `:q`.

The only command line editor that I was able to use was [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano).

![Emacs](/assets/emacs.png "Emacs")
![Nano](/assets/nano.png "Nano")

Then, last year, while taking a look at the [Ruby survey results](http://www.askr.me/ruby) I was surprised to see replies to the [text editor of preference](http://www.askr.me/ruby#6) question. To summarize:

- Vim has gone from 17% in 2008 to 38% in 2015.
- Emacs varies around 5-8%.
- Textmate has gone from 57% in 2008 to 6% in 2015.
- Sublime has gone from 18% in 2012 to 36% in 2015.

Emacs being in single digit percentage did not surprise me. Texmate going down or Sublime going up did not surprise me. What *did* surprise me was Vim going up from year to year. What?! I have decided to spend some time and learn the basics. A few months ago I have carefully [replaced](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/commit/a21f4bb5834695dafba64e7c59a05694eaf52fdc) editor in my `.gitconfig` from `nano` to `vim`.

# The basics

All I know

# .vimrc

You will probably want to tweak your Vim configuration file, `.vimrc`. A good starting point is [.vimrc](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc) at Vim Tips wiki. Feel free to take a look at my [.vimrc](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

# Misc

- I will give a talk titled *Vim for beginners or What is this I don’t even...?!* at [Terminal Zagreb Meetup #5](http://www.meetup.com/terminal-zg/events/221415994/) so now is a perfect time to put my thoughts on paper. I mean... You know what I mean.
