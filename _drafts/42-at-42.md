# The idea

I've had a crazy idea of running 42 km (26 miles) on my 42nd birthday. I had it too late, too close to the birthday. (Maybe even after the birthday.) I did run a half-marathon (21 km or 13 miles) at [28th Zagreb marathon](/28th-zagreb-marathon), a couple of days after the birthday. After some soul searching, I've realized that I'll have 42 years for an entire year, so not everything was lost.

# The plan

The original plan was to run [Wachau marathon](http://www.wachaumarathon.com/) in September 2020, but it was cancelled. [Zagreb](https://www.zagreb-marathon.com) marathon was a couple of weeks later, in October 2020, so that was also an option. Not an ideal one, because it was on my 43rd birthday, so 42@42 was not going to happen. Anyway, it was also cancelled. So, I've decided to run alone on October 10, the last day when I'm still 42.

# The history

I didn't just decide to run a marathon. I've started running in 2002. I've ran my first half marathon in 2002 (01:59:48). I've ran my best half marathon in 2007 (01:45:25). That was also the last half-marathon before the break. I don't have a perfect archive, but I've probably ran 9 half-marathons from 2002 to 2007.

In 2006 I won my only medal. (I do have other medals, but those are finisher medals that are awarded to every participant that finishes the race.) I've participated in a year-long local running league and finished 25th. That's how good I am at running. But, more importantly, I was third in my age group. So, I got a bronze medal. The only evidence I have is a [post](https://web.archive.org/web/20060502000919/http://iskusivac.blog.hr/arhiva-2006-02.html#1620692065) on my old blog (archived at archive.org). The post says the medal is a result of "persistence, bad results and weak competition".

I've stopped running in 2007.

After a decade long pause, I've started running again in 2016. It took me a while to get back to half-marathons. I've ran my first half-marathon in 2019 (01:57:10). The fastest half-marathon was in 2020 (01:45:04). As far as I can tell from my records, that's also my fastest half-marathon ever. Even faster than the one in 2007. (Take that, 13-years-younger-me.) I've ran 4 half-marathons after 2016.

# Differences

The biggest difference is the technology. Watch with GPS and heart rate monitoring. Maps. Apps.

# The route

There are several bridges on the Sava river that divides Zagreb in two parts. I usually run on it's riverbank. The plan was to run a [loop](https://www.strava.com/routes/2743077047428850084) from Jankomirski most (Jankomir bridge) to Domovinski most (Homeland bridge). Strava says it's 44 km (27 miles), but I think the route builder tool made a few mistakes, so it should be about 42 km (26 miles).

# The training

Training for a half marathon is a lot of running. TODO: how much (km, miles, hours).

How many books I've read. How many km/miles/hours for (half)marathon (total, month, week).

September 2020 is the only month in my life in which I've run more than 300 km (186 miles). I've ran 337 km (209 miles).

# The goal

I had several goals.

- To finish the race. Even if I had to walk part of it.
- To finish the race without any walking.
- To finish the race in certain time.

# The race

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/4175767922/embed/4662776e26bae79a697084e8d88a630050f1b62d'></iframe>

I was expecting the race to be easier. But, I made a typical beginner mistake. I've started too fast (5:30 min/km). It was able to keep the tempo for the first 25 km, then I started to get really tired and every kilometer I was slower and slower. I've managed to complete the first two goals. I've finished the race and I didn't walk at all. I wasn't even close to the time I wanted to achieve.

My wife helped me a lot. She rode on a bike next to me so I didn't have to carry a few liters of water in my backpack the whole time.

# Recovery

I was expecting that recovery after the race will take longer. After the race, my legs were really tired, and my knees complained seriously. I was expecting that the next day my leg muscles will hurt more. It's a couple of days after the race and I'm still tired any my leg muscles hurt a bit, but I was expecting more pain.

# The future

I'm planning to write an article: You don't want to run a marathon (and other running advice).

I'm split between "I'm never doing this again" and "I have to do this again".

If I ever run a marathon again, I'll start seriously slower. Instead of 5:30 min/km, I'll try something like 6:30 min/km. This race my average speed was 6:46 min/km. I think I can maintain 6:30 min/km the entire race. But then, that's what I thought about 5:30 min/km a few days ago.
