<p>The first draft.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Guidelines+for+Posting+to+Watir+General+Google+Group">Guidelines for Posting to Watir General Google Group</a></p>
<p>Please take a look. It is a wiki page, so if you want something do add or edit (or delete), go ahead. The page is still not linked from anywhere, so if the community thinks it is not a good idea, we can always delete it.</p>
