title: Don't Go to Conferences
---
I have been thinking about conferences a lot lately. I even proposed a session at a recent Testival conference about not going to conferences. While writing this post, I did some research. I was surprised how many was already written on the topic.

I have been to a lot of [conferences](/event). I have been a [speaker](/speaker) at a few. I have even helped [organize](/organizer) a few. I like going to conferences. I also think that going to the most of the conferences is a waste of time.

What are other ways of learning new things?

- Videos
- Blog posts
- Podcasts
- Books
- Creating something yourself.
- I have never attended a virtual conference (but I did attend live online presentations).
- If you decide to spend a day or two staying at home and reading a book or watching talks recorded at a conference, you could learn way more that you could if you went to a conference. I have thought about that a lot, but never done it. I am not sure why.

Benefits of a conference?

- Networking? It can also happen on social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook...).
- Also, keep in mind that some conferences will be a disappointment, no matter how much you have prepared.

Cost of a conference?

- Travel
- Hotel
- Food
- Drinks
- Ticket
- Time that you could have used more wisely.
  - On a conference, if the talk you are listening to is not interesting, sometimes you can go to another talk, but sometimes you can not. At home, you could just start another video. At a conference, you are stuck for 30 or 60 minutes.

Why people go to conferences?

- Company has sent them.
- Sightseeing.
- Grow your professional network.
- Learn something new.
  - I guess before the Internet happened, going to conferences would be a great place to hear new ideas. Books also. Today, you can watch great talks from home.
- Give a talk.
  - Speaking at a conference (even just a 5 minute lightning talk) would probably be the best thing to do. That also (for some conferences) means you are invited to a speakers' dinner, and that is in my experience a great networking opportunity.
- See old friends.

What to do to get the most of the conference?

- Go to talks.
- Take notes.
- Take a few photos.
- Write a blog post.
- Talk to people. Not just the people you know. It is really hard to me to start talking with people I do not know, but when the other person starts the conversation, it is usually an interesting one. I have experimented with starting the conversation myself and to my surprise, I can do it too. :)
- Bring plenty of business cards.
- Go to workshops. Listening to a talk can be interesting, but learning something new and using it immediately is when you actually learn something.
