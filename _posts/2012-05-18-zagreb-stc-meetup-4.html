<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki">Zagreb STC MeetUp</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/59949652/">#4</a>. As always, it was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Šmid</a> at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, about ten of us appeared. We started by introductions. Everybody said a few words about themselves, and the conversations just started. And lasted for more than 3 hours. We were talking mostly about everyday challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We were also talking about <a href="http://www.scribd.com/Cyril%20Wang/d/12567324-A-Close-Look-at-the-Five-Schools-of-Software-Testing">Five Schools of Software Testing</a>, upcoming local conference on software testing <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/">viaqa</a> and the talk on software testing that a few of us plan to give at <a href="http://www.webstrategija.com/14">Web::Strategija 14</a> conference.</p>
<p>A few of us brought the books they own and our little <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki/Library">library</a> continues!</p>
<p>Of course there, were pizza and soft drinks. (Thanks Karlo.)</p>
