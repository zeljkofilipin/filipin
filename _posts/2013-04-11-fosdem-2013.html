<p>In early February I was at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/">FOSDEM</a> in Brussels, Belgium. Since I am writing about it now, you can imagine how much I remember. I have some notes and I took photos so I will be able to write at least a few words.</p>
<p>The trip started at Zagreb airport where I have met <a href="https://twitter.com/k0st">Vlatko Košturjak</a> so I was not travelling alone. Since we arrived on Friday, we have decided to go to <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/practical/beerevent/">Friday beer event</a>, but it was way to crowded. Luckily, there were plenty of places in the near with beer.</p>
<p>I have started the Saturday with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/keynote_vibrant_developer_community/">How we made the Jenkins community</a> keynote by Kohsuke Kawaguchi (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_we_made_the_Jenkins_community_by_Kohsuke_Kawaguchi.jpg">photo</a>). I have spent the vast majority of the first day in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/">Testing and Automation devroom</a>. The first talk I saw there was <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/automating_openstack_testing/">Automating OpenStack Testing on Ubuntu</a> by James Page. The room was surprisingly full for this talk (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Testing_and_Automation_devroom_at_FOSDEM_2013_Photo_1.JPG">photo</a>). It was followed by <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/mobile_bdd_with_calabash/">BDD for Mobile using Calabash</a> by Karl Krukow (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BDD_for_Mobile_using_Calabash_by_Karl_Krukow.JPG">photo</a>).</p>
<p>Then I gave <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/testing_mediawiki/">How MediaWiki, software that runs Wikipedia, is tested</a> talk (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Testing_and_Automation_devroom_at_FOSDEM_2013_Photo_2.JPG">photo</a>). I have noticed the talk mentioned in <a href="http://www.agilelevelup.com/2013/02/fosdem-2013-cote-code.html">Fosdem 2013, coté code</a> blog post (in French).</p>
<p>The next talk that I saw was <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/scaling_jenkins_for_fast_tests/">Scale your Jenkins build pipeline automatically to minimize test time</a> by Anders Nickelsen (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scale_your_Jenkins_build_pipeline_automatically_to_minimize_test_time_by_Anders_Nickelsen.jpg">photo</a>). My notes say I was also at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/building_testing_mobile_apps_jenkins/">Building, testing and deploying mobile apps with Jenkins & friends</a> by Christopher Orr, but I could not find any photos. The last event in the room was <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/jenkins_dev_meetup/">Jenkins Developer Meetup and Birthday Toast</a> by Kohsuke Kawaguchi (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jenkins_Developer_Meetup_and_Birthday_Toast">photos</a>).</p>
<p>All talks from the devroom were recorded, but unfortunately the laptop that had the recordings was stolen.</p>
<p>I have ended the Saturday with <a href="http://www.hackerspace.be/Bytenight_Bye_Bye_Garage">ByteNight</a> (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ByteNight_Poster_at_FOSDEM_2013.jpg">photo</a>).</p>
<p>I have started the Sunday with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/research_data_analyst/">Measuring the Wikipedia Community</a> talk by my colleague Ryan Faulkner (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Measuring_the_Wikipedia_Community_by_Ryan_Faulkner.JPG">photo</a>). I also saw <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/how_to_hack_on_wikipedia/">How to hack on Wikipedia</a> talk by another colleague, Quim Gil and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/challenges_gnome/">Has the GNOME community gone crazy?</a> by Vincent Untz (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Has_the_GNOME_community_gone_crazy_by_Vincent_Untz.JPG">photo</a>).</p>
<p>The majority of the Sunday I was browsing the stands. The most interesting ones were <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/aldebaran_robotics/">Aldebaran Robotics</a> (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aldebaran_Robotics_Stand_at_FOSDEM_2013.jpg">photo</a>) and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/games_pandora/">Pandora</a> (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pandora_Stand_at_FOSDEM_2013.JPG">photo</a>).</p>
<p>We also had Wikimedia meetup (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikimedia_Meetup_at_FOSDEM_2013">photos</a>), where I have met a lot of my colleagues for the first time. (I work from home.)</p>
<p>I have finished the day with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/keynote_keeper_of_secrets/">The Keeper of Secrets</a> keynote by Leslie Hawthorn and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/closing_fosdem/">Closing FOSDEM 2013</a> talk by FOSDEM Staff (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Closing_FOSDEM_2013_by_FOSDEM_Staff.JPG">photo</a>). Since the event is completely free (as in free beer) they do not know the number of people that was there, but if I remember correctly the estimate was about 7000.</p>
<p>And for the end, looks like I am not the only one that finds <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=taste+the+coke+side+of+belgium">little boy peeing</a> (into the bottle?) on a Coke machine funny. I hope somebody got promoted for that.</p>
