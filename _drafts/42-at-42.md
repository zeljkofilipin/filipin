# The idea
I've had this crazy idea of running 42 km (26 miles) on my 42nd birthday. I wasn't ready at the time, so I've ran a half marathon (21 km or 13 miles) at [28th Zagreb marathon](/28th-zagreb-marathon). After some soul searching, I've realized that I'll have 42 years for an entire year, so not everything was lost.

# The plan

The original plan was to run [Wachau marathon](http://www.wachaumarathon.com/) in September, but it was cancelled. [Zagreb](https://www.zagreb-marathon.com) marathon was a couple of weeks later, in October, so that was also an option. Not an ideal one, because it was on my 43rd birthday, so 42@42 was not going to happen. But, it was also cancelled. So, I've decided to run alone on October 10, the last day when I'm still 42. (With some help from family and friends. Like, riding with me on a bike so I don't have to carry a few liters of water in my backpack the whole time.)

# The history

I didn't just decide to run a marathon. I've started running in 2002. I've ran my first half marathon in 2002 (01:59:48). I've ran my best half marathon in 2007 (01:45:25). That was also the last half-marathon before the break. I don't have perfect archive, but I've probably ran 9 half-marathons from 2002 to 2007. I've stopped running in 2007.

TODO: Bronze medal for a local running league in ?, link to blog post. Looks like it's lost. :(

Started running again in 2016. First half marathon after the break in 2019 (01:57:10). Fastest half-marathon after the break in 2020 (01:45:04). Number of half-marathons after the break: 4.

(I'm planning to write an article: You don't want to run a marathon and other running advice.)

# The route

There are several bridges on the Sava river that flows thru Zagreb. I usually run on it's riverbank. The plan was to run a [loop](https://www.strava.com/routes/2743077047428850084) from Jankomirski most (Jankomir bridge) to Domovinski most (Homeland bridge).

# The training

Training for a half marathon is a lot of running. TODO: how much (km, miles, hours).

How many books I've read. How many km/miles/hours for (half)marathon (total, month, week).

September 2020 is the only month in my life in which I've run more than 300 km (186 miles).
