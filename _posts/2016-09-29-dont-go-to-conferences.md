title: Don't Go to Conferences
---

I have been to a lot of [conferences](/event). I have been a [speaker](/speaker) at a few. I have even helped [organize](/organizer) a few. I like going to conferences. I also think that going to the most of the conferences is a waste of time.

If you decide to spend a day or two staying at home and reading a book or watching talks recorded at a conference, you could learn way more that you could if you went to a conference. I have thought about that a lot, but never done it. I am not sure why.

Why people go to conferences?

- Company has sent them.
- Sightseeing.
- Grow your professional network.
- Learn something new.
- Give a talk.
- See old friends.

Most of the above topics.

What to do to get the most of the conference.

- Go to talks.
- Take notes.
- Take a few photos.
- Write a blog post.
- Talk to people.
