<p>At <a href="http://filipin.eu/zagreb-stc-meetup-5/">Zagreb STC MeetUp #5</a> last week we were playing <a href="http://www.thebreretons.com/setgame/">The Set Game</a>. We were talking about automating it, and a few of us had different ideas on how to do it. It looked like an interesting little project, so I have spend a few hours on it. The code is at <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/set">github.com/zeljkofilipin/set</a> and I have recorded a short <a href="https://archive.org/download/filipin.eu/set.mov">screencast</a> of one game.</p>
