title: The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
---
I bought *[The Passionate Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer-2nd-edition/)* by Chad Fowler during December 2019 sale. It spent a lot of time in my to-read stack. I've finally read it in November 2020.

I've read the 2nd edition with subtitle *Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development*. As far as I understood it, the first edition of the book was called *My Job Went to India* with subtitle *And All I Got Was This Lousy Book*.

Both books have pretty good rating at Goodreads. [The Passionate Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer) 3.95 (4,003 ratings) and [My Job Went to India](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4103.My_Job_Went_to_India) 3.96 (188 ratings). Surprisingly, both books have a decent number of low ratings and reviews.

I'm so glad I've read the book now, because I'm working on a blog post with related topic, career development. This book will teach you how to build your career as you would build a product or a company. *You* are in charge of your career, *you* should develop it. Assess your current situation, assess the market, make a plan, build your career, invest some time and effort in marketing.

A few of the advice from the book that really resonated with me.
