<p>This morning I was pleasantly surprised when I found a piece of e-mail in my inbox from Lothar Scholz, developer of  <a href="http://www.ruby-ide.com/ruby/ruby_ide_and_ruby_editor.php">Arachno Ruby IDE</a> saying that <a href="http://www.scriptolutions.com/weblog/index.php?/archives/1-Whats-going-on-with-Arachno.html">Arachno is not dead</a>. I have been using it for years, but recently I switched to <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> because Arachno really looked dead. I will give Arachno another try.</p>
