<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I have <a href="http://filipin.eu/2006/09/29/google-reader/">blogged</a> already about <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>. I was using <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, but I was not entirely happy with it. I heard that Google Reader has been significantly updated, so I decided to try it. After a day or two, I switched completely to Google Reader. I just love how it looks like e-mail client.</span></p>
