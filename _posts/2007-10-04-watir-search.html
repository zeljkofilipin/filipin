<p>I added <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir web site</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Project+Home">wiki</a> and <a href="http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR">bug tracker</a> to <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=007267089725385613265%3Agmydx5gtw6u">Watir Search</a>. I think it is the best that custom search covers all main Watir related sites. Let me know if you do not think this is a good idea or if you would like more sites added. Of course, other comments are welcome.</p>
