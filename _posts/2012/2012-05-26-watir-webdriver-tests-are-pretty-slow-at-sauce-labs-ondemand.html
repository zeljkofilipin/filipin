title: watir-webdriver Tests Are Pretty Slow at Sauce Labs OnDemand
---
<p><img src="/assets/blowball-300x300.jpg" alt="Random Croatian Countryside" title="Random Croatian Countryside" /></p>
<p>That <a href="/watir-webdriver-and-sauce-labs-ondemand/">Sauce Labs OnDemand</a> thing is pretty nice, but I have noticed something strange. A test suite that takes about 20 minutes to run at my machine, takes 5 hours to run there! Uh-oh. Not what I have expected.</p>
<p>After googling around, and I have found that you can speed up the tests by <a href="http://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand/additional-config#performance">disabling video, screen shots and advisor</a>. So, I have decided to test how fast are the tests with default settings and with everything disabled.</p>
<p>This simple script visits a few pages. In my test it visits 9 client sites. You can visit <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">top 10 sites</a>, for example, if you want to run the test yourself.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require "rubygems"
require "watir-webdriver"
browser = Watir::Browser.new
sites = [
  "google.com",
  "facebook.com",
  # add more sites
]
sites.each do |site|
  browser.goto site
end
browser.close
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Run the script 10 times (or more, if you have the time) to make the results at least a bit statistically significant. Measure the time it takes to run the script at your machine and at Sauce Labs OnDemand, with various operating system and browser combinations.</p>
<p>I got this results.</p>

<p>The script that just opens the browser, visits 9 pages and closes the browser takes 14 seconds on average at my machine. Exactly the same script at Sauce Labs OnDemand takes on average 55-69 seconds with default settings, and 48-64 seconds with everything disabled. So, the script <em>is</em> a bit faster when everything is disabled, but unfortunately, just a bit.</p>
<p>The entire script is here:</p>

<p>You have to replace <code>username</code> and <code>api-key</code> with your username and API key.</p>
<p>The only solution I have found so far is to run the tests in parallel. Report coming soon.</p>
