<p><a href="http://awta.wikispaces.com/AWTA+2009">AWTA 2009</a> was a lot of fun. At <a href="http://awta.wikispaces.com/Notes+from+AWTA+2009">Notes from AWTA 2009</a> you can find a lot of images, notes, podcasts, blog posts, presentations, twitter feed...</p>
<p>It was great to finally meet in person a lot of people I knew on-line for years. I have learned a lot how other people test. Also, Austin and Texas were very interesting to explore. I think all is already said about AWTA 2009. I just hope I will be there the next year too.</p>
