title: The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler

I bought [The Passionate Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer-2nd-edition/) (2nd edition), *Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development* by Chad Fowler during December 2019 sale. It spent a lot of time in my to-read stack. I've finally read it in November 2019. I'm so glad I've read it now, because I'm working on a blog post with related topic, career development.
