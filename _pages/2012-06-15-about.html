<blockquote><p>Svetlana Vasiljeva, EnterpriseWizard:<br />
“We hired Zeljko as Watir specialist to help us with Watir automation solutions. This is the best Watir automation specialist which I'ever met. Zeljko is a creative, intelligent, proactive engineer. He is perfect both as a team worker and as an expert. His level of expertise is very high. He is perfect not only in finding the best solutions for tests automation, but in the helping other team members to improve quality of their work. I am looking forward to working with Zeljko.”<br />

<blockquote><p>Bret Pettichord, Manager, Quality Assurance, Blackbaud:<br />
"I have had the great pleasure to work with Zeljko on the Watir project. Over the years, he has taken the initiative to improve our docs, update our wiki, respond to questions from users and contribute to the code base. He has been a catalyst for so many things -- the podcast, the pledgie, the conferences -- the project would not be the same without him. He has a great attitude and has really helped our community grow."<br />

<blockquote><p>Felipe Knorr Kuhn, Software Engineer, Yahoo!:<br />
“Željko is one of the most dedicated open source community members I know. I have seen his work in the Watir community ever since I started getting involved with the project. As a community manager, he is always available to help and has spent countless hours answering people on the Watir mailing list, helping writing the official documentation, recording and editing podcasts and even writing a book on Watir.”<br />

<blockquote><p>Gabe Yarra, HomeSwap:<br />
“Zeljko has been a tremendous asset to HomeSwap, and I've enjoyed working with him very much. He helped HomeSwap create a suite of automated acceptance tests and set up a cloud based continuous integration system that does exactly what I want it to do. Throughout the process Zeljko showed he is an expert when it comes to automated testing, a true professional, and a nice guy. He's also a great communicator with a lot of integrity. I look forward to continuing to work with Zeljko, and I couldn't imagine anyone better at helping companies set up automated test solutions.”<br />
