I've installed Linux on many machines. I've even installed it on a few Mac machines. What I never got right is how to [dual boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) Linux and macOS. The missing piece of the puzzle was a tool called [bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader). When installing a Linux on a non-Mac, bootloader is installed and works just fine. The problem is that Macs have a different way of loading the operating system, so a special bootloader is required. The one that was recommened at several places was [rEFInd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REFInd).

To make things as easy as possible for me, I've decided to dual boot Ubuntu. I've assumed it's the most user friendly.

I was installing Ubuntu on a MacBook Air with (with no DVD drive) so the only option was booting from a USB stick. Official Ubuntu [Create a bootable USB stick on macOS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview) instructions were good. The only thing that I didn't like was that they recommend installing at tool (Etcher) to create a bootable USB stick. I prefer not to install tools that I will use only once, especially when there's a built in command line tool already in macOS that will do that. See [ How to install Ubuntu on MacBook using USB Stick](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20install%20Ubuntu%20on%20MacBook%20using%20USB%20Stick).

The trick is that recent Macs have SIP (System Integrity Protection). You have to disable it while installing rEFInd.

Boot into recovery mode (restart and hold command+R), open Terminal and execute this to disable SIP.

    csrutil disable

Reboot and install rEFInd. Boot into recovery mode again and enable SIP.

    csrutil enable
