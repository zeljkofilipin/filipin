I read a lot of books. I have always read a lot of books. I think I've started reading picture books before I learned how to read.

# Goodreads

In 2016, I've stumbled upon an amazing site. Goodreads. It's like Facebook for book people.

I read a lot of books. These are my stats according to Goodreads.

In [Books That Have Changed My Life](/books-that-have-changed-my-life) I've created a table with some Goodreads stats.

| Year | Books |
| 2016 |    68 |
| 2017 |   178 |
| 2018 |    90 |
| 2019 |   112 |
| 2020 |   208 |
| 2021 |    17 |

# Audible

I used to listen to a lot of podcasts. Then I've stumbled upon audio books. I have some statistics since 2015. I listen to 30-40 hours of audio books each month. That's about an hour a day.

I have two accounts, audible.com and audible.co.uk. That makes things a bit more complicated. I've also listened to a few books on Kindle Unlimited and Audible Stories.

In general, Audible has terrible features for exploring and sorting your library.

# What is a book?

For the purposes of this articles, I will consider a book anything that Goodreads thinks is a book. Including picture books and audio books.
