> Rachel Thomas, Wikimedia Foundation/FOSS Outreach Program intern:  
> Zeljiko was my mentor as I was interning at Wikimedia as a QA intern. He did an outstanding job in every way. I was most impressed that he gave freely of his time to assist me in learning and writing the automation tests used at Wikmedia. He was an excellent teacher, with the ability to be empathic, and at the same time provide expert assistance and guidance. Zeljko was also an excellent technical resource, with a deep knowledge of the Cucumber/Ruby/Selenium/Watir web driver tests we were writing. The knowledge and wisdom he has imparted upon me was of great help and support throughout my internship, and will surely last into my future. I highly recommend him for future mentorship roles!
