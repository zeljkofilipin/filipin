- (In)security of Croatian Internet space, Marko Stanec

> How [CERT](http://www.cert.hr/) handles security incidents. Very interesting talk, with a lot of discussion during the talk. As any good security talk should end with, it was mentioned that there is no absolute security. (Insert quote from slide.)

- OWASP project, Vlatko Košturjak

> An overview of OWASP project. I have heard several talks about the project so far, and I always learn something new. Tonimir Kišasondi talked about OWASP IoT top 10. In short. It's bad. They have also talked about local OWASP community.
