title: Rubik's Cube for Coders
---
I don't really remember how I got interested in Rubik's cube. All I do remember is that in 2014 I had a small cube and I decided to learn how to solve it. I had a lot of fun in the next couple of years, even had some competition with friends, but by 2016 I have lost interest. Recently a friend asked me to help him learn how to solve the cube and I got interested again.

Since then, I've noticed that most of the people think you have to be really smart and figure out yourself how to solve the cube. You have to be really really smart if you want to figure it our yourself. For the rest of us, there are instructions. There are many tutorials available. I prefer one at rubiks.com, but even that one is not perfect.

History: An Hungarian architect Erno Rubik invented the cube in YEAR. He did not know how to solve it, algorithms were developed in the following years.
Sizes: The most popular cube is 3x3x3. 2x2x2 are also popular and easy to solve. 4x4x4 are also popular, but there are many more sizes.
Types: Basically, there are two types, regular and speed cube. Regular can be disassembled, but don't do that unless you know what you are doing. Speed cube can't be disassembled, and you can recognize it by screws under each center piece. You can tighten and loosen them to make the cube harder or easier to move.
Quality: Luckily, a good cube does not cost much, 5-10 EUR/USD. Anything cheaper will not be of a good quality. There is no need to buy anything more expensive than 10 EUR/USD, especially in the beginning. A good cube should be easy to move, should not block while moving and should not fall apart. This is not a joke, I've had cheap cubes that fell apart as I was solving them.
Where to buy: most toy stores will have decent quality cubes. Look for brand Rubiks. It should cost 5-10 EUR/USD. Rubiks.com is also a good place to buy cubes. I have bought a few cubes on ebay and at least one from the street vendor.

How is the cube solved? In steps. You have to observe the state of the cube, determine where you are and which algorithm to apply to progress to the next step.

With just 7 relatively simple algorithms and some practice, you should be able to solve the cube in 2-3 minutes. With additional 2-3 algorithms, you can improve to 1-2 minutes.

This tutorial will be about 3x3x3 cube. I might write about 2x2x2 in the future.

# Introduction

## Pieces

The cube has six sides and three types of pieces. Center piece on each side has only one color and it does not move. Edge pieces have two colors, corner pieces three colors.

## Sides

In order to apply algorithms we need some notation. When you look at the cube, it has six faces, right (R) - left (L), up (U) - down (D), front (F) - back (B). Each face can be rotated clockwise, or counter-clockwise. Moves are usually 1/4 rotation.

# Step 1: white cross

The hardest thing is to start, and you have already done that. To solve the white cross, position the cube so the white center piece is up, find edge piece (two colors, remember?)
