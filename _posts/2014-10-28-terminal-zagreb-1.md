Last week I was at [Terminal Zagreb Meetup #1](http://www.meetup.com/terminal-zg/events/212502312). Since today I am going to another meetup, I have to document this one, before I forget what happened. :)

After short introduction by Matija Marohnić ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Zagreb_Meetup_1_Matija_Marohni%C4%87.jpg)), Bruno Sutic talked about Tmux basics ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Zagreb_Meetup_1_Bruno_Sutic.jpg), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/brunosutic/tmux-osnove)), Janko Marohnić talked about Vim plugins ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Zagreb_Meetup_1_Janko_Marohni%C4%87.jpg), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/janko_m/hidden-features-of-your-vim-plugins)) and world famous Mislav Marohnić had talked free style about various terminal tools, including already mentioned Tmux and Vim ([photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Zagreb_Meetup_1_Mislav_Marohni%C4%87.jpg)).

What have I learned?

- Tmux is an useful tool. I am using it right now, while writing this blog post.
- Vim can be extended beyond your dreams.
- Mislav has a couple of brothers.
