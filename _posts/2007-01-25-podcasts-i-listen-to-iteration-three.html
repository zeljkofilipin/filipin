<p>When I posted list of <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/2007/01/10/podcasts-i-listen-to-reloaded/">podcasts that I listen to</a>, I forgot <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/Podcasts/">stickyminds.com podcasts</a>. I forgot to mention it because it does not have separate feed, so it was not labeled as podcast. You will have to subscribe to <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/rss/">one of stickyminds.com's feeds</a>.</p>
