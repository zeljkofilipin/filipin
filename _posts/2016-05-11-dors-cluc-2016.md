I am feeling very proud wearing my [DORS/CLUC 2009](/dors-cluc-2009) T-shirt. :D Random idea: a place to put jackets would be nice.

There are a lot of papers in the conference bag, but the only really interesting is [Free Your Android](https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html). Pretty interesting exhibition in the hall. Check the photo gallery for details.

- The long way to empower people to control technology, Matthias Kirchner

> Interesting stories about his work with [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) and fighting for open standards and free software in government. Free your Android is probably the most interesting to me. Also, asking governments to include links to open source PDF reader, not just to Adobe Reader.

- Alpha2Omega: Open Source Software in In-Vehicle Infotainment, Dorian Ivančić

> Story about how [Rimac Automobili](http://www.rimac-automobili.com/en/) uses open source. It started with a few photos of their fancy racing electric cars, continued with overview of the hardware. I started understanding stuff when the talk reached operating system, [OpenEmbedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEmbedded)/[Yocto Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto_Project). Interestingly, they are not making money on their fancy cars, but by selling services and parts to other manufacturers. Fancy cars are just for marketing. This was probably the most interesting talk of the conference, and there were tons of questions after the talk. It is great to see that such cutting off technology is developed in Croatia.

- LibreItalia and Italian best practices of migration to LibreOffice, Sonia Montegiove

> I know this stuff is important, but I don't really care.

- LibreOffice moves online, Ozcan Esen

> An overview of the technology of online version of LibreOffice. I was not even aware that there is such a thing. Cool.

- Infrastruktura VoIP, Davor Jovanović

> Technical details of VoIP installation for a big local educational institution.

- Open Source Hardware, why we do it and why it matters, Tsvetlan Usunov

> [DIY OSHW Laptop Kit 2015-2016](https://olimex.wordpress.com/tag/laptop/) is the most interesting thing. In general, an overview of open source hardware, just like the title says.
I do not really think about picking a license for your open source hardware project. Interesting.

- Make your web solutions more flexible with layout and block management, Ivo Lukač

> I did not really get this talk. According to the questions from the audience after the talk, I was not the only one. In short, the talk was about design and development of complex web sites.

- REST API - iskustva iz prakse, Denis Kranjčec

> An overview of REST and how it is used in a big local educational institution.

- Free Technology, Free Societies, Aaron Seigo

> A quote from the talk: "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past." is from [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingsoc) by George Orwell. I did read a book, but it was a while ago. I remember the quote from [Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testify_%28Rage_Against_the_Machine_song%29). :)

- Docker Security, Vlatko Košturjak

> Vlatko is a good speaker, I have seen a few of his talks, and they are always interesting. In this one he covered the basics of Docker and it's security. In short, it is pretty secure by default, but there are additional things that you could and should do to make it even more secure.
