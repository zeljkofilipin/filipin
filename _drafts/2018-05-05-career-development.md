title: Career Development
---
I am very interested in [career development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_development). I gave lightning talks about it at [Testival](/testival-31) meetup and [WebCamp](/webcamp-zagreb-2017) conference in 2017 and lead a session on it at [CITCON](/citcon-2018) conference in 2018. I have been trying to talk about it at [Testival meetup](/zagreb-stc-18) in 2015 and [Testival conference](/testival-2016) in 2016.

I have many notes about the topic, but I do not think I am ready to write a post about it. But, since a few people have asked me to share the notes, I will do my best.

All three events where I talked about the topic were in two parts. First, I would ask the audience what they think is a good way of career development, take notes, and only then share my thoughts. All three times I got different results. The first two times were short five-minutes long lightning talks, but they helped me advance my thoughts. The last time was a one hour open-space session, and it was very different in many ways. I will share my notes, organized by event.

# Testival

So what did people at Testival meetup think would help you develop your career?

- Contribute to open source projects.
- Go to events, like meetups, conferences and workshops.
- Read. Books, blogs, documentation, magazines...
- Have a Twitter account and use it to connect to people from your industry.

- Learn the tools needed for work. Since Testival gathers testers, they were mostly interested in test automation tools.
- Try new things. Tools, programming languages...
- Have a blog and write about work related topics.
- Watch relevant videos, on YouTube for example.
- Look for a company that would help you advance in your career.

# CITCON

TODO: get Andy's notes from Slack.

CITCON session was much longer than previous two, and completely different.

- Go to events, like meetups, conferences and workshops.
- Establish online presence: LinkedIn...
- Networking is important.
- Speak at events.
- Have a Twitter account and use it to connect to people from your industry.

- There are several ways to think about career:
  - personal development,
  - climbing the ladder in your current company.
- In both of the above cases, you should talk with your manager about your career.
- Improve your development skills, with Udacity for example.
- Reflect about your career. Yearly review is a good way to do it.
- Follow the market (LinkedIn...). What is in demand?
- Be active at LinkedIn.
- Acquire new skills.
- Get a mentor. It does not need to be a permanent or formal relationship. Anybody you are seeking advice from could be your current mentor.
- Stay in touch with people you meet at events. A relevant email/Twitter/Slack message every few months should be enough.
- Focus.
- Practice interviews. Apply for a job here and there just to keep your interviewing skills.

# My Thoughts

Some of my thoughts, not mentioned above.

- It is very unlikely that you will reach retirement age while still working for your current company.
- You are in responsible for your career.
- Time to start thinking about your career is now.
- You should be the one to decide when to retire. You should not get into situation that your skills are obsolete.
