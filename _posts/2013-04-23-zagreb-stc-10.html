<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2013/04/announcement-for-zagreb-stc-10-meetup.html">Zagreb STC MeetUp #10</a>. This is the first time the meetup was at <a href="http://zipzg.com/">ZIP.Factory</a>. We had the first international speaker, <a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a>. Gojko had an hour long talk and then we had an hour or two of discussion. The talk mentioned <a href="http://impactmapping.org/">impact mapping</a> and <a href="http://www.mindmup.com/">MindMup</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Before the meetup, <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo</a> and I picked up Gojko at the airport and gave him a short tour around downtown Zagreb. After the meetup we drove him to Tuhelj. He had a talk at <a href="http://agileadria.com/">Agile Adria</a> conference earlier today.</p>
<p>I am really happy to say that our small <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki/Library">library</a> continues. The books were returned and loaned.</p>
<p>Update: Karlo wrote about <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2013/04/zagreb-stc-10-report.html">Zagreb STC MeetUp #10</a> in more detail.</p>
