<p>I wanted to copy a file from Ruby. Documentation for <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/File.html#M002607">File#copy<br />
</a> said that </p>
<p>[source:ruby]<br />
File.copy(from, to)<br />
[/source]</p>
<p>should work. But, I got this error message:</p>
<p><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `copy' for File:Class</code></p>
<p>Google search led me to <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/131302">ruby-talk post</a> that said I should do:</p>
<p>[source:ruby]<br />
require "ftools"<br />
[/source]</p>
<p>I am just surprised that documentation did not make that clear.</p>
